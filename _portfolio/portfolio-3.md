title: "Human Phone Usage Recognition on Streets Based on OpenPose"
excerpt: "
OpenPose algorithm is used to detect the skeleton and joint points of pedestrians in real-time monitoring. According to the posture of pedestrians using mobile phones, nine joint points of the upper body are selected to extract three features.To detect whether a pedestrian on the street is using a mobile phone, a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) model is trained and tested. The final recognition accuracy can reach 91.2%
